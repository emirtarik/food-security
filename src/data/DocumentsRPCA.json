Without appropriate measures, 44.5 million individuals could face acute food and nutritional insecurity by the lean season of June-August 2024, with over 2 million in urgent need. Furthermore, 85.6 million people currently under food pressure might fall into crisis without adequate interventions. Members of the Food Crisis Prevention Network urge stakeholders to take urgent action to save 31.7 million lives and build a future free from food and nutritional crises. ",

      "Description": "The Set of Instruments is a group of practices and tools for responding to food and nutrition crises. The context that motivated this first revision is notably marked by multifactorial food and nutrition crises linked to a combination of shocks of various kinds: climatic (droughts, floods, etc.), socio-economic (markets, inflation, purchasing power, gender-based violence -GBV-, etc.), security (conflicts and other forms of violence) and health (Ebola, COVID-19). These food and nutrition tensions are occurring in a context where states are increasingly short of resources due to the accumulation of crises and the sharp increase in demand for basic social services driven by rapid population growth. Thus, the revised Set of instruments combines prevention, preparedness and management measures with resilience building and sustainable livelihood recovery.  ",

The response measures to covid-19 have affected the living conditions of herders, who have adapted their resilience strategies. Although it is not always easy to dissociate the impacts linked to the coronavirus pandemic from other constraints (insecurity, climate change, other government decisions, etc.), the information collected from herders shows that insecurity remains the main obstacle to pastoral mobility today. This illustrated report provides insights based on 7 key ideas. It is based on data and analyses collected between May 2020 and February 2021 by the RBM as part of the monitoring system for the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic on pastoral households.

Hunger and malnutrition could affect 38.3 million people by June if appropriate measures are not taken. Countries in central Sahel and Lake Chad are by far the most affected. This situation is a result of long-term structural issues including poverty, a lack of availability and access to basic social services and chronic insecurity. Recent socio-economic shocks, extreme weather events and the impacts of Covid-19 and the war in Ukraine are all exacerbating the food and nutrition situation.",

These analyses cover 107,868,747 people. At the regional level, the results show that 10,756,750 people will face food deficits by September 2021. This is a very large increase (+31.5%) compared to the November 2020 cycle. During this period, the results also show that 2,256,350 people will face survival deficits equivalent to phase 3 or higher (223,235 in Burkina Faso, 503,081 in Niger, 323,851 in Northern Nigeria, 155,940 in Mali, 434,632 in Chad and 418,503 in Mauritania). ",

      "Description": "In light of the regular evaluation of the PREGEC Charter within the national food security framework, the second evaluation was conducted in 2017-18, at a time when states and their partners were investing enormously in the management of food and nutrition crises. Based on these substantial financial commitments, coupled with the negative impact on States’ ability to engage in more structural and preventive interventions, the members of the Food Crisis Prevention Network (RPCA) decided to focus the second evaluation of the PREGEC Charter on an analysis of the performance and effectiveness of responses to food and nutrition crises. This document takes stock of the state of implementation of recommendations made by the second evaluation.",

The general objective is to set up climate smart food production systems (mitigation and adaptation) in West Africa by experimenting and capitalising on innovative practices and mechanisms focusing on 1) adaptation to ensure food and nutrition security (i.e. seeds selection, climate services, agro-ecological practices, early warning systems); 2) soil restoration (4 per 1000, agroforestry, etc.); 3) mitigation (carbon sequestration, renewable energy in the processing units, etc.); and 4) competitiveness and sustainability of regional production sectors. More particularly, the project aims to fund innovative projects, promote partnership approaches and capitalise on research-action experiences. In terms of budget, grant proposals should be made for projects with a total cost of EUR 150 000-230 000.  The overall amount available under this call for proposals is EUR 2.6 million. The deadline for submission of concept notes is on 28 June 2020, at 23h59 UTC.Find out more        Authors :     ECOWAS/RAAF ",

In total, the population at risk in West and Central Africa could feasibly double the figures projected in the Cadre harmonisé analysis given the inclusion of highly vulnerable populations living in urban slums and those already vulnerable (previously in phase 2). The paper includes a special focus on impacts on local food markets. ",

All Sahelian and West African countries affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, have implemented social distancing measures. In March, the impacts of these measures were relatively light in countries where markets were functioning well before the crisis. On the other hand, countries in which markets’ situation was already fragile (The Gambia, Liberia, Mauritania, Niger, Senegal and Sierra Leone) could face further deteriorations (supply chain disruptions and price increases). In several of these countries non-seasonal price increases of 10% to 20% have already been recorded in monthly variations for food products",

It proposes three measures to prevent a food security crisis: 1) To contain economic harm by ensuring the smooth flow of global trade;  2) To monitor food prices and markets and make sure that information is transparently; and 3) To provide support to the most vulnerable countries and populations.",

      "Description": "The report, produced by the Office of the Chief Economist for the Africa Region, analyses the impact of Covid-19 on the African economies. The analysis builds on two scenarios. The first—an optimistic scenario—is based on the assumptions that the pandemic peaks in advanced economies such that containment measures are gradually removed in the next two months, the pandemic fades in China, and outbreaks are contained in other countries and in Sub-Saharan Africa. The second—a downside scenario—assumes that the COVID-19 outbreak continues to weigh on the economy in the third and fourth quarters of 2020 and into 2021, as some social distancing measures are required to keep the spread of the virus at manageable levels. According to the analysts, temporary debt relief will be necessary for fighting COVID-19 while preserving macroeconomic stability in the region.",

The meeting took place in a unique and challenging context as the security crisis continues to compound food and nutrition vulnerabilities. RPCA members sounded the alarm over the critical food and nutrition situation in the Sahel and West Africa. Conflict and insecurity have escalated to unprecedented levels in parts of the Sahel. The number of food insecure people has more than doubled since 2018. Members recognised that addressing food insecurity and malnutrition in conflict-affected settings cannot be “business as usual”. They highlighted the need for humanitarian assistance, long-term development and peacebuilding activities to be aligned, highlighting the fact that this requires strong political commitment, innovative policies, tools and instruments, as well as stronger links between humanitarian and development actors. The RPCA messages have been widely echoed in the media. They have been published and translated into French, Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch but also into Bambara, Sonrhai, Peulh and Tamasheq.",

It also aims to promote the emergence of innovative solutions on the ground to strengthen climate resilience of rural and agricultural stakeholders. The ECOWAS Commission promotes “an integrated approach to processing and redirecting agricultural systems in order to durably and equitably increase agricultural productivity and income, boost adaptation and resilience against climate variability and change, and to sequester and/or reduce greenhouse gases where possible and appropriate”. It has put in place the West African Alliance for Climate Smart Agriculture. This call for proposals aims to set up climate smart food production systems (mitigation and adaptation) in West Africa through experimentation (research-action4) and by capitalising innovative practices and mechanisms. A webinar will be organised on 25 September 2019 at 10:00 UTC. The deadline for submission of proposals is set on 17 October 2019, at 12:00 UTC.Find out more         Authors :     ECOWAS/RAAF ",

The IFAD Rural Development Report 2019 analyses key challenges of the rural transformation process and opportunities available to rural youth while encouraging thinking differently about investing in rural youth. “Neither rural development policies and investments nor youth-specific interventions can be effective in ensuring the inclusion of the young population unless they are considered as a part of broader development efforts. An effective approach to rural youth policy and investment is therefore one that strikes the right balance between creating broader rural opportunities and fostering youth-specific ones”, conclude the authors.

Beyond the many security, humanitarian and environmental challenges, the problems in the Sahel have their roots in the inequality and the strong sense of injustice among the region’s people, particularly young people. Combatting inequality in all its forms will require “designing fairer and more equitable policies and modes of governance that align with the needs and aspirations of populations in Sahel countries.” The report offers a series of recommendations in order to reduce inequality and deliver on the SDGs. They notably call upon Sahelian countries to uphold their commitments and allocate at least 20% of their national budgets to education and 15% to health. Moreover, the G5 Sahel should place more emphasis on development and governance. In conclusion, the authors call for strong and co-ordinated responses from all actors beyond the current response, which is mainly focused on security.        Authors :     Oxfam  ",

      "Description": "Geography matters. Within countries, food and nutrition security situations (FNS) vary significantly. National analyses typically mask pockets of poverty, hunger and malnutrition concentrated in specific geographic areas, particularly rural areas. Rapid urbanisation and continued population growth mean that food insecurity is also becoming an increasingly urban issue. A territorialapproach to FNS recognises the need to tailor policy responses to local contexts and challenges. It also recognises the importance of harnessing rural-urban linkages so that no-one is left behind. This paper has been prepared as contribution to the thematic session of the 33rd RPCA annual meeting, held from 4-6 December 2017 in Cotonou, Benin.",

The performance and effectiveness of some of these response plans to food and nutrition crises were reviewed under the second evaluation of the “Charter for Food Crisis Prevention and Management”. Provisional results point to significant funding gaps, poor implementation, and an overall lack of ownership by governments. New mapping tools will promote the sharing and scaling-up of best practices on resilience; provide an overview of who is doing what and where on the ground in terms of food and nutrition security and resilience interventions; and make data on the current, projected and past food and nutrition situations more accessible to stakeholders.",

An increasing number of stakeholders are working on food and nutrition security (FNS) in the Sahel and West Africa. Often, their interventions are implemented in isolation, without any logical coherence or search for synergy. This results in duplicate interventions, wasted resources and conflict, negatively affecting the efficiency of collective action around FNS. The study was conducted from September 2016 to February 2017 and identified some 430 projects across the 17 Sahelian and West African countries. Validated results of this study are available online on the RPCA mapping tool “ACTIONS”. The team faced many challenges in relation to the accessibility and reliability of information. Information, even institutional information, is not necessarily accessible to institutions that have set them up, or to their partners. The outcome is thus a starting point for the creation of a more complete inventory.",

Chad’s NRP-AGIR report has four main sections: 1) analyse of the root causes of food and nutrition crises; 2) targets and vulnerable areas; 3) resilience priorities; 4) funding requirements. The analysis identified some 800 000 chronically vulnerable households (or 4.2 million people). The implementation of the NRP-AGIR should translate into a boost for the implementation of agro-sylvo-pastoral and fisheries development projects, in the areas of social protection, nutrition and the governance of food and nutritional security. Chad’s NRP-AGIR report was adopted at a national validation workshop on 6 April 2016.        Authors :     Government of Chad  ",

This code of good conduct has revolutionised co-operation between beneficiary countries and their partners. In particular, it has helped reduce in-kind food aid that often disrupted the local food economy. Current food crises are more complex and multi-faceted than in the past. The region’s population has doubled. Nearly half of the West Africans live in urban areas. And global markets have an increasingly important role to play. The Charter has been revised so that it can adapt to the region’s profound transformations. In 2012, the 17 States of the region and their partners adopted the Charter for the Prevention and Management of Food Crises – also called  PREGEC Charter. The PREGEC Charter addresses the root causes of food crises. It now covers all of the region’s countries and integrates new stakeholders including NGOs and the private sector. The Charter calls on signatories to strengthen information systems and dialogue platforms, and to ensure that interventions are coherent.   ",

The first part recalls the history of famines in the Sahel and analyses the food situation at the time. The document then highlights key achievements in the field of food crisis prevention and management, using the example of Mali. Among the flagship achievements: the Food Aid Charter (1990), a code of good conduct aimed at better managing food aid. While the Network now offers a space for dialogue and co-ordination, the region is undergoing profound changes and is faced with new risks that the Network must address. ",

It focuses on food security policies, information systems, food security consultation and co-ordination efforts and improved food aid management. “Food crisis prevention appears to be one of the main innovations in food policies during the past decade”, indicates the document. However, the Network and the Sahelian region must address many new challenges. The document highlights three new priorities for the Network: 1) raise awareness of donors and States about the need to make food crisis prevention mechanisms sustainable, particularly woth a view to ensuring effective and sustainable monitoring; 2) play an active role in the analysis of new risks of food security and possible responses, by bringing the state of the debate to the attention of Sahelian officials and co-operation agencies; 3) develop methods to identify new latent risks. “The prevention of new forms of food crises implies taking greater account of the populations’ adaptation strategies to the various factors affecting household income and access to food, particularly in urban areas”, the report concludes.

      "Description": "At the initiative of the Secretariats of CILSS and the Club du Sahel, the participants of the Food Crisis Prevention Network in the Sahel met on 23-24 October 1985 at the OECD headquarters in Paris. All agencies participating in food aid in the Sahel were represented. Participants took stock of the 1984-85 agricultural campaign. “At the end of 1985, the Sahel found itself in a very instructive situation. After a serious food shortage, a surplus crisis threatens the Sahel”, indicates the summary record. “Both crises – shortage and abundance – highlight the same problem:  the weakness of food policies in the Sahelian countries, including poor control over food aid. These aspects of the same crisis made Sahelian governments and co-operation agencies somewhat helpless. There is therefore still a lot to do to prevent food crises; first, we need to learn from recent experiences”, the report concludes. ",

The report defines five central functions for the Network: 1) the evaluation of productions, deficits and surpluses; 2) improvement of procedures; 3) logistical problems; 4) implementation modalities; and 5) food aid and development. “The network will have to remain very informal; this informal character will be a necessary condition for its success », concludes the report. Eleven countries and institutions participated in the meeting ( Canada, CILSS, FAO, France, the Food Strategy Network, The Netherlands, People’s Right Action, Sonagral, WFP and the World Bank) ",
