  "Disclaimer": "Data is provided by CILSS through the Cadre Harmonisé program. Any map included herein, are without prejudice to the status of or sovereignty over any territory, to the delimitation of international frontiers and boundaries and to the name of any territory, city or area. The classifications in the comparison table shows the worst phase of the food and nutrition situation in the country. The data is subject to change as new information becomes available. \n\n **June = Projection (Scenario)**. June figures are Cadre Harmonisé projections (“most-likely scenario”) for June–August, built from evidence-based hypotheses about seasonal risks and explicitly including humanitarian food assistance that is planned, financed, and feasible for that window. They are not observed outcomes. When March outcome data are unavailable, the June figure may be an update of the November cycle’s initial projection based on new contributory-factor data, with the same June–August validity. Use June for forecasting / communication only; **do not infer causal or seasonal changes from March→June differences**. Confidence reflects scenario assumptions, and population by phase is derived by convergence of evidence with the 20% rule; where possible, prefer shares over absolute counts.",
